# Unified-Cross-Domain-Recommender-System
Learn a shared user representation from interactions across various platforms

Ideas
Dual-Domain Personalization:
Create a recommendation system that suggests movies and news articles based on a unified profile. Evaluate if cross-domain signals improve recommendation accuracy.

Correlation Analysis:
Investigate patterns between movie genres and news topics. For example, do users who rate documentaries highly also engage more with in-depth news articles?

Hybrid Recommender System:
Develop a system that combines collaborative filtering (from MovieLens ratings) and content-based filtering (from both movie reviews and news text) to generate enriched recommendations.


Below is a step-by-step plan that covers all of the project ideas—dual-domain personalization, cross-domain correlation analysis, and hybrid recommender systems—using MovieLens and MIND:

Step 1: Data Acquisition and Familiarization
Download the Datasets:
MovieLens: Obtain the latest version (e.g., MovieLens 1M or 10M) from MovieLens.
MIND (Microsoft News Dataset): Download from MIND News Dataset.
Read Documentation:
Understand schema details (user ratings, review texts, news articles, impression logs, etc.) for both datasets.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning:
Remove duplicates and handle missing values in both datasets.
Normalize rating scales if necessary.
EDA for Each Dataset:
MovieLens: Analyze distributions of ratings, movie genres, user activity, and review text length.
MIND: Explore article categories, click distributions, and user engagement patterns.
Visualization:
Create histograms, scatter plots, and word clouds to gain insights into the content and user behavior.
Step 3: Feature Extraction with NLP
Textual Data Processing:
Apply tokenization, stop-word removal, and possibly lemmatization to both movie reviews and news article texts.
Embedding Generation:
Use a transformer model (e.g., BERT) to generate semantic embeddings for:
Movie review texts (from MovieLens).
News article content (from MIND).
Topic Modeling:
Optionally, run LDA or similar methods to extract underlying topics from both domains.
Step 4: Building Baseline Models
Domain-Specific Recommenders:
For MovieLens: Develop a collaborative filtering baseline (e.g., matrix factorization or user/item-based CF).
For MIND: Build a content-based or click-through prediction model using article embeddings.
Evaluation:
Measure baseline performance with metrics like RMSE, precision@K, recall@K, or NDCG.
Step 5: Learning Unified User Representations
Multi-Task / Transfer Learning:
Train separate embedding models on each dataset.
Align these embeddings into a shared latent space using multi-task learning so that common user preferences are captured.
Fusion Strategy:
Consider a joint loss function that optimizes for both movie ratings and news clicks simultaneously.
Step 6: Cross-Domain Correlation Analysis
Analyze Relationships:
Examine how movie genre preferences correlate with news topic interests.
Use clustering (e.g., k-means) or correlation metrics on the shared user embeddings.
Visualization & Insights:
Create heatmaps or network graphs to display cross-domain correlations.
Identify patterns such as users who favor certain film genres also engaging with specific news topics.
Step 7: Building the Cross-Domain Recommender
Model Architecture:
Design a two-tower neural network:
User Tower: Ingests unified user embeddings from both datasets.
Item Tower: Has separate branches for movies and news articles using content embeddings.
Training:
Train the model on both types of interactions (ratings for movies and click/impression data for news).
Recommendation Generation:
The model should be able to recommend a mixed slate of movies and news articles based on the unified user profile.
Step 8: Developing a Hybrid Recommender
Combine Techniques:
Merge collaborative filtering (from MovieLens ratings) with content-based recommendations (from textual embeddings).
Ensemble Strategy:
Use weighted averaging or stacking to combine predictions from the CF model and the content-based model.
Experimentation:
Compare performance against the domain-specific baselines and the unified cross-domain model.
Step 9: Evaluation and Iteration
Metrics:
Use both domain-specific (e.g., RMSE for movies, CTR for news) and overall cross-domain metrics (e.g., NDCG, MRR).
A/B Testing / Offline Simulation:
Simulate user interactions to test the real-world impact of cross-domain recommendations.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize model parameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization.
User Studies:
Optionally, gather feedback from a small user group to validate the recommendations qualitatively.
Step 10: Documentation and Future Extensions
Documentation:
Document your data preprocessing steps, model architectures, evaluation results, and insights from correlation analysis.
Future Work:
Explore adding more domains (e.g., social media data) or real-time context (e.g., location) to further enrich the model.
Deployment Considerations:
Plan for scaling, handling data privacy, and integrating with a live system if moving toward production.


Note: This project is being done in conjunction with various AI agents. Especially ideation.
