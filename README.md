# Unified-Cross-Domain-Recommender-System
Learn a shared user representation from interactions across various platforms

Ideas
Dual-Domain Personalization:
Create a recommendation system that suggests movies and news articles based on a unified profile. Evaluate if cross-domain signals improve recommendation accuracy.

Correlation Analysis:
Investigate patterns between movie genres and news topics. For example, do users who rate documentaries highly also engage more with in-depth news articles?

Hybrid Recommender System:
Develop a system that combines collaborative filtering (from MovieLens ratings) and content-based filtering (from both movie reviews and news text) to generate enriched recommendations.
